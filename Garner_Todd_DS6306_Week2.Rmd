# R Markdown - Week 2 Assignment

This is an R Markdown document. It will be my first attempt at the Week 2 Live assignment constructed and commented solely in RMarkdown.  I intend to restate each question within the assignment and provide the code within the document.  I also am going to practice my GitHub skills by creating a repo for this assignment.  My GitHub repo is CTG-SMU-DataHub.  I'll use "knitr" to knit the questions together to make one coherent set.  

## Bullet Point 1 - *Use the PlayerBBall.csv dataset to visually represent (summarize) the number of players in each position.*

First, I will load the PlayerBBall.csv into RStudio. Taking a peak at the data set with MS Excel, there are 4550 observations (rows) and 8 columns and the data set contain headings.   It would seem that a bar chart with the positions on the x-axis makes sense and then a simple count.  After reading in the data set and giving it a variable name, ggplot function within the ggplot2 package will allow this scheme to come alive.  
```{r}
p <- read.csv("/Users/tgarn/OneDrive/Desktop/SMU - MS Data Science/Courses/GitHub/DS_6306_weekly_assignments/Week_2/PlayersBBall.csv", header = TRUE)

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

p %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x = position)) + geom_bar(stat = "count")
```

This provides the bar chart expected but the number is only an approximation.  ggplotly would provide an interactive means to bring specificity to this answer.  
```{r}
library(plotly)
library(ggthemes)

z = p %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x = position)) + geom_bar(stat = "count") + theme_wsj()

ggplotly(z)

```
This is a much more satisfying interactive chart that provides an exact count of each position. 

## Bullet 2 - *Use the dataset to visually investigate the distribution of the weight of centers (C) is greater than the distribution of the weight of forwards (F).*

There are likely numerous ways to investigate the distribution of the weights of centers (C) and forward (F), but the most straight forward is the boxplot, as show below.  

```{r}
p %>% ggplot(aes(x = position, y = weight)) + geom_boxplot()

ggplot(p)
```
This answers the question, but it leaves me wanting a better visual solution.  A solution that:
1. Isolates centers and forwards
2. Quantifies the weight distribution for each position

I will devote a half hour to seeking a solution.  

First, to isolate the centers and forwards from the rest of the positions. Then, take the weight of the centers and then the weight of the forwards.  


```{r}
C = p[p$position == "C",]
F = p[p$position == "F",]

WC = .colMeans(C$weight, length(C), 1, na.rm = FALSE)
WF = .colMeans(F$weight, length(F), 1, na.rm = FALSE)

paste("The average weight of the centers is,", WC,"pounds, and the average weight of the forwards is,", WF,"pounds.")
```
I recognize that although numerically pleasing, it doesn't specifically address the issue of "visualizing" the difference in weights.

Since I spent an hour on this, I'm hoping that the combined solution will satisfy the client.  

## Bullet 3 - *
