 DS6306 Week 2 Live Session

I'm not happy with this code set that I produced.  I refuse to accept sloppy work like my own.  

# Questions and Takeaways

## Takeaways
My Key Takeaway, Time management and using my resources available are elements that I must improve.  I spun a lot of cycles wasting time writing and re-writing code that did not work.  I did find YouTube University which helped on several of the bullet point questions contained herein.  I was able to solve some of the issues I faced and took shortcuts on early on in the questions but did not have enough time to go back and repair this issue.  What I did worked, but the quality of the work is not what I would accept and something I'd be loath to turn in as a finished work product.   The saving grace is that I am in school to learn and that's what I've done is learned several hard lessons on how to plan, plan some more, research and then attack.  I found myself locked in a battle with RStudio that I just lost.  I've got to come to the battlefield better prepared next time.  A learning experience.  

Another takeaway is that I need to learn the nuts and bolts of wrangling data in R.  I think that was a large part of my problem was being able to get the data into a format that I needed, evaluate that data and then post it to a visualization.  Those steps are elluding me write now.  Practice will help.  

## Questions
The videos and written material were excellent, but I still am seeking an "R Bible" that has all functions in detail with examples.  Perhaps one exists?  Maybe it's one of the better websites out there?  I have some cheatsheets that I've found useful.  I'm looking for something more unabridged.
